## What is [LetsPy](https://www.letspy.tech/)? 🤔

People learn better when they can learn with a community of likeminded peers. LetsPy is a Python Programming BootCamp that in previous 3 editions (1 in Pune and 2 in Nagpur) taught more than 2000 beginners in Python programming and open source development. It is an endeavor to encourage participation in the open source coding community, a hub to nurture passion and learn and grow with amazing resources, mentors and activities. A Bootcamp improves the technical knowledge of individuals, with training and support from various renowned professionals in the subject. Once you complete the training, you will have access to resources and support provided by the team, such as swags, presentations, attendee kit and the opportunity to attend events organized by GirlScript Foundation or GirlScript Chapter Leads like meetups and GirlScript Summit, etc.
